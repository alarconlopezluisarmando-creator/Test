Hi, 

I need to read from a db three different tables using SQL form Alteryx using the python module. 

Could you help me to create the code:

1. below are the connection: 
# Database connection details
server = '105.52.12.43'
port = 1433
USERNAME = 'RF_Read_Only'
PSSWD = 'Samsung2024!'
DB = 'ViaeroDWH'

connection_string = f"mssql+pyodbc://{USERNAME}:{PSSWD}@{server}:{port}/{DB}?driver=ODBC+Driver+17+for+SQL+Server&Encrypt=yes&TrustServerCertificate=yes"

engine = create_engine(connection_string, fast_executemany=True)

a. first table need to be this query:
WITH StatusCounts AS (
  SELECT 
    [P:Viaero Phase],
    SUM(CASE WHEN [P:[QB]] RFDS Review Status Text] = 'Approved' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS [Fully Approved],
    SUM(CASE WHEN [P:[QB]] RFDS Review Status Text] = 'Rejected' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Rejected,
    SUM(CASE WHEN [P:[QB]] RFDS Review Status Text] = 'Pending Review' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS [Pending Review],
    COUNT([P:Project ID]) AS Total_Sites
  FROM 
    [ViaeroDWH].[dbo].[OV_Quickbase]
  WHERE 
    [P:Viaero Phase] <> 'Pending'
    AND [P:Viaero In SEA Scope] = 'YES'
    AND [C:Site Name (SPMS)] <> 'CO-KARVAL'
  GROUP BY 
    [P:Viaero Phase]
), PhaseRenamed AS (
  SELECT 
    CASE 
      WHEN [P:Viaero Phase] = 'Phase 3 E//' THEN 'Phase 5'
      ELSE [P:Viaero Phase]
    END AS [P:Viaero Phase],
    [Fully Approved],
    Rejected,
    [Pending Review],
    Total_Sites
  FROM 
    StatusCounts
), FinalResults AS (
  SELECT 
    [P:Viaero Phase],
    Total_Sites,
    COALESCE([Fully Approved], 0) AS [Fully Approved],
    COALESCE(Rejected, 0) AS Rejected,
    COALESCE([Pending Review], 0) AS [Pending Review],
    Total_Sites - (COALESCE([Fully Approved], 0) + COALESCE(Rejected, 0) + COALESCE([Pending Review], 0)) AS [Pending Submission],
    COALESCE([Fully Approved], 0) + COALESCE(Rejected, 0) + COALESCE([Pending Review], 0) AS [Total Submissions]
  FROM 
    PhaseRenamed
), FinalResultsWithApproval AS (
  SELECT 
    [P:Viaero Phase],
    Total_Sites,
    [Fully Approved],
    Rejected,
    [Pending Review],
    [Pending Submission],
    [Total Submissions],
    CASE 
      WHEN [Total Submissions] = 0 THEN 0 
      ELSE ROUND(([Fully Approved] * 1.0 / [Total Submissions]) * 100, 2) 
    END AS [Approval %]
  FROM 
    FinalResults
)
SELECT 
  [P:Viaero Phase],
  Total_Sites,
  [Fully Approved],
  Rejected,
  [Pending Review],
  [Pending Submission],
  [Total Submissions],
  [Approval %]
FROM 
  FinalResultsWithApproval
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'Total',
  SUM(Total_Sites),
  SUM([Fully Approved]),
  SUM(Rejected),
  SUM([Pending Review]),
  SUM([Pending Submission]),
  SUM([Total Submissions]),
  CASE 
    WHEN SUM([Total Submissions]) = 0 THEN 0 
    ELSE ROUND((SUM([Fully Approved] * 1.0) / SUM([Total Submissions])) * 100, 2) 
  END
FROM 
  FinalResultsWithApproval;
  
b. Second table, need to be this 
WITH PendingDaysCTE AS (
  SELECT 
    DATEDIFF(DAY, [P:[QB]] Date Added], CAST(GETDATE() AS DATE)) AS DaysPending
  FROM 
    [ViaeroDWH].[dbo].[OV_Quickbase]
  WHERE 
    [P:[QB]] RFDS Review Status Text] = 'Pending Review'
    AND [P:Viaero In SEA Scope] = 'YES'
    AND [C:Site Name (SPMS)] <> 'CO-KARVAL'
)
SELECT 
  COALESCE(CAST(DaysPending AS VARCHAR(10)), 'Grand Total') AS DaysPending,
  COUNT(*) AS Count
FROM 
  PendingDaysCTE
GROUP BY 
  DaysPending
WITH ROLLUP

c. And the third table need to be this:
SELECT *
FROM [RFDS_History ]
