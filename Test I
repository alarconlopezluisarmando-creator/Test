2. For the same table, I need to add months since today until Agust 2026, and per each month I need to divide by week. 
3. Accourding for each column, we need to count the values and add for the week that corresponding. 
4. Per each row, I need to add an extra row with the same name but adding "cumulative"; this row is going to be the count for the current week plus the last week. 
5. In differetn sheet I, I need the same table but doing an acount per month only and I need to cumulative row too. 
6. At the end, I need something like this: 

					2025	2025				2025					2025				2025			
	1.5				May	June				July					August				September			
Weekly	F/A	OV MS#	Task Name		Wk 22	Wk 23	Wk 24	Wk 25	Wk 26	Wk 27	Wk 28	Wk 29	Wk 30	Wk 31	Wk 32	Wk 33	Wk 34	Wk 35	Wk 36	Wk 37	Wk 38	Wk 39
