hI, 

I need for the column [RFDS Approval History], the date that are comming inside, and the status, these cand be Approved, Rejected, Pending Review,
for each day I need a count with out duplicates for each of project ID, is one of the is empty, I need you put 0.

Dates need to be the columns and the status the rows. 

;WITH Dates AS (
  SELECT DATEADD(DAY, -7, GETDATE()) AS DateValue
  UNION ALL
  SELECT DATEADD(DAY, 1, DateValue)
  FROM Dates
  WHERE DateValue < GETDATE()
)
SELECT 
  d.DateValue AS ApprovalDate,
  COALESCE(a.ApprovedCount, 0) AS ApprovedCount,
  COALESCE(a.RejectedCount, 0) AS RejectedCount,
  COALESCE(a.PendingReviewCount, 0) AS PendingReviewCount
FROM 
  Dates d
  LEFT JOIN 
    (
      SELECT 
        TRY_CONVERT(date, LEFT([RFDS Approval History], 10)) AS ApprovalDate,
        SUM(CASE WHEN [RFDS Review Status Text] = 'Approved' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ApprovedCount,
        SUM(CASE WHEN [RFDS Review Status Text] = 'Rejected' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS RejectedCount,
        SUM(CASE WHEN [RFDS Review Status Text] = 'Pending Review' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS PendingReviewCount
      FROM 
        [ViaeroDWH].[dbo].[QB_RFDS_3days]
      WHERE 
        TRY_CONVERT(date, LEFT([RFDS Approval History], 10)) IS NOT NULL
      GROUP BY 
        TRY_CONVERT(date, LEFT([RFDS Approval History], 10))
    ) a 
  ON 
    d.DateValue = a.ApprovalDate
OPTION (MAXRECURSION 0)
