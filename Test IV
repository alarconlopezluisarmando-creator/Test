    ;WITH Dates AS (
      SELECT DATEADD(DAY, -7, GETDATE()) AS DateValue
      UNION ALL
      SELECT DATEADD(DAY, 1, DateValue)
      FROM Dates
      WHERE DateValue < GETDATE()
    )
    SELECT @dates_pivot += 'SUM(CASE WHEN ApprovalDate = ''' + CONVERT(nvarchar(10), d.DateValue, 120) + ''' THEN [Value] ELSE 0 END) AS [' + CONVERT(nvarchar(10), d.DateValue, 120) + '],'
    FROM Dates AS d
    OPTION (MAXRECURSION 0);

    -- Remove the last comma
    SET @dates_pivot = LEFT(@dates_pivot, LEN(@dates_pivot) - 1);

    SET @sql = N'
