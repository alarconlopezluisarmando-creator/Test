hI, 

I need for the column [RFDS Approval History], the date that are comming inside, and the status, these cand be Approved, Rejected, Pending Review,
for each day I need a count with out duplicates for each of project ID, is one of the is empty, I need you put 0.

Dates need to be the columns and the status the rows. 

SELECT
    Status,
    COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN [Approval_Date] = CONVERT(DATE, GETDATE() - 0) THEN [Unique_Projects] ELSE 0 END), 0) AS 'Day_0',
    COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN [Approval_Date] = CONVERT(DATE, GETDATE() - 1) THEN [Unique_Projects] ELSE 0 END), 0) AS 'Day_1',
    COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN [Approval_Date] = CONVERT(DATE, GETDATE() - 2) THEN [Unique_Projects] ELSE 0 END), 0) AS 'Day_2',
    COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN [Approval_Date] = CONVERT(DATE, GETDATE() - 3) THEN [Unique_Projects] ELSE 0 END), 0) AS 'Day_3',
    COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN [Approval_Date] = CONVERT(DATE, GETDATE() - 4) THEN [Unique_Projects] ELSE 0 END), 0) AS 'Day_4',
    COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN [Approval_Date] = CONVERT(DATE, GETDATE() - 5) THEN [Unique_Projects] ELSE 0 END), 0) AS 'Day_5',
    COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN [Approval_Date] = CONVERT(DATE, GETDATE() - 6) THEN [Unique_Projects] ELSE 0 END), 0) AS 'Day_6'
FROM
    (SELECT
        CAST(JSON_VALUE([RFDS Approval History], '$.date') AS DATE) AS [Approval_Date],
        JSON_VALUE([RFDS Approval History], '$.status') AS Status,
        COUNT(DISTINCT [Site - Project Name]) AS [Unique_Projects]
    FROM
        [ViaeroDWH].[dbo].[QB_RFDS_3days]
    WHERE
        CAST(JSON_VALUE([RFDS Approval History], '$.date') AS DATE) >= CONVERT(DATE, GETDATE() - 6)
        AND JSON_VALUE([RFDS Approval History], '$.status') IN ('Approved', 'Rejected', 'Pending Review')
    GROUP BY
        CAST(JSON_VALUE([RFDS Approval History], '$.date') AS DATE),
        JSON_VALUE([RFDS Approval History], '$.status')
    ) AS Subquery
GROUP BY
    Status
ORDER BY
    Status;
